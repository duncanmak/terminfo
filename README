 Terminfo library
==================

This is a Scheme library for accessing the terminfo database on Unix/Linux
systems. It's based on terminfo.lisp written by Paul Foley
(http://users.actrix.co.nz/mycroft/cl.html).

This library has been tested on Scheme48 1.3 as well as Scsh 0.6.7.

To load in Scheme48 1.3,

> ,config ,load interfaces.scm s48-let-opt.scm s48-packages.scm
> ,open terminfo

To load in Scsh 0.6.7,

> ,config ,load interfaces.scm scsh-packages.scm
> ,open terminfo

A sample test program is available at 'tests/termhl.scm'.
