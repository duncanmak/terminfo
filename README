 Terminfo library
==================

This is a Scheme library for accessing the terminfo database on Unix/Linux
systems. It's based on terminfo.lisp written by Paul Foley
(http://users.actrix.co.nz/mycroft/cl.html).

This library has been tested on Scheme48 1.3, Scsh 0.6.7 and MzScheme
v372.

To load in Scheme48 1.3,

> ,config ,load interfaces.scm s48-let-opt.scm s48-packages.scm
> ,open terminfo

To load in Scsh 0.6.7,

> ,config ,load interfaces.scm scsh-packages.scm
> ,open terminfo

To load in MzScheme v372,

> (load "plt-load.ss")

A sample test program is available at 'tests/termhl.scm'.

> ,open terminfo srfi-13
> ,load tests/termhl.scm
